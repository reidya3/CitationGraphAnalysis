## Preamble
An initial study of researcher relationships within DCU’s school of computing revealed little collaboration. In this investigation, we  explored this observation further.  First, we scraped faculty member’s Google Scholar and DORAS profiles  to  extract    nuggets  of  information  using  the BeatuifulSoup and Selenium libraries on pySpark.  Next, we explored our inital observation further by employing graph algorithms using GraphX.  Overall, we believe that the results generated from this investigation are crucial for understanding research partnerships within DCU. We hope that our work may provide useful information which will enable cooperation, especially for early researchers who may not know the expertise and influence of certain faculty members.
