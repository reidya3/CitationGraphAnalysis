Hello,

I am the administrator of DORAS - the non-commercial open access Institutional Repository at Dublin City University, Ireland. I am contacting you on behalf of my colleague Rory O'Connor.

He wrote the following article:

Harnessing Software Development Contexts to Inform Software Process Selection Decisions. Software Quality Professional Vol. 16(1) (2013).

He wishes to upload this to the open access Institutional Repository at http://doras.dcu.ie

Is this allowed? Does ASQ have an open access policy?

Thanks for your time and help.
Regards,
Fran Callaghan",,
